### Aim of the experiment

Ordering of events are a vital backbone in many systems. Transactions must be processed in the right order to have meaning - be it computational or financial.
Logical clocks step in when synchronizing clocks in a system with different time source. Scalar logical clock provides a simple first step to solving this problem. However, it fails at enforcing causality of events. Vector logical clocks attempt to close this gap.
