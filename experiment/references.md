1. **Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System – Leslie Lamport (Loyola University Chicago)**  
   *Usefulness:* The foundational paper introducing Lamport’s logical clocks and the happened-before relation—essential for understanding scalar logical time theory.

2. **Clocks and Synchronization – Loyola University Chicago**  
   *Link:* https://ds.cs.luc.edu/clocks/clocks.html  
   *Usefulness:* Explains logical clocks, vector clocks, and physical synchronization with clear illustrations; helpful for understanding how scalar clocks fit within broader clock mechanisms.

3. **Distributed Systems (3rd Edition) – M. van Steen & A. S. Tanenbaum**  
   *Usefulness:* Provides practical examples of Lamport clocks and event ordering in distributed systems; useful for understanding how scalar logical time is applied in real system architectures.

4. **Totally Ordered Multicast & Vector Clocks – Princeton University**  
   *Link:* https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall22/cos418/docs/L6-vc.pdf  
   *Usefulness:* Offers a comparison of Lamport clocks and vector clocks, and explains total ordering in distributed messaging; helps contextualize scalar time in relation to stronger ordering guarantees.

5. **Distributed Computing: Principles, Algorithms, and Systems – A. D. Kshemkalyani & M. Singhal**  
   *Usefulness:* Provides algorithmic details and formal proofs related to logical clocks, mutual exclusion, and event ordering; useful for implementing accurate scalar logical time simulations.
